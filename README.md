## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" >Git</a> is a distributed version control system used for software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, keeping track of changes and managing versions. It also enables users to revert changes and collaborate more effectively.

<a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> is a JavaScript runtime, package manager, test runner bundler built from scratch using the Zig programming language. It was designed by Jarred Sumner as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. Bun uses JavaScriptCore as the JavaScript engine, unlike Node.js and Deno, which both use V8.

<a href="https://www.mongodb.com//">MongoDB</a>  is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License.
